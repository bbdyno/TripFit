# TripFit Privacy Policy

Effective date: 2026-02-20

TripFit ("we", "our", or "us") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how TripFit handles your information.

## 1. Data We Collect

TripFit is designed to work offline-first and can be used without creating an account.

Depending on your usage, TripFit may store:
- Wardrobe data (item names, categories, colors, tags, notes)
- Outfit and trip planning data (names, dates, destinations, notes)
- Photos you add to wardrobe items (from camera or photo library)
- App preferences (theme, UI options, sync toggles)

## 2. How Data Is Stored

- By default, your data is stored locally on your device.
- If you enable iCloud sync, TripFit uses Apple's CloudKit/iCloud services to sync your data across your devices.
- If "Include Wardrobe Photos" is enabled in sync settings, wardrobe photos are also included in iCloud sync.

## 3. How We Use Data

Your data is used only to provide app features, including:
- Managing wardrobe, outfits, and trips
- Syncing data between your devices (when enabled)
- Restoring your data on your own Apple devices

We do not sell your personal data.

## 4. Data Sharing

We do not share your data with advertisers or data brokers.

When iCloud sync is enabled, data is processed by Apple under Apple's iCloud/CloudKit terms and privacy practices.

## 5. Data Retention and Deletion

- Local data remains on your device until you delete it or remove the app.
- Synced iCloud data remains until you delete it from the app or iCloud.
- In-app reset actions may permanently remove local and/or iCloud data.

## 6. Security

We use Apple's platform security mechanisms and reasonable safeguards. However, no storage or transmission method is 100% secure.

## 7. Children's Privacy

TripFit is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

## 8. Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy from time to time. The latest version is published in this document.
